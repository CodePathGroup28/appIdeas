## New App Ideas

* Chore App (with housemates)
* App that can 'read' parking signs and checks how long a car can be parked there and sends reminders to move the car. 
* GPS App that notifies recent crimes, local news. 




## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
* **Description:** Allows housemates to track individual chores for each other in a house. This can include assigning chores to each user (housemate), push notifications for when the timer is close to expiring for the chore, and just reminding housemates to do their chores (:
* **Category:** Utilities 
* **Story:** Allows for housemates to easily track who's doing what, and make sure that the chore is done.
* **Market:** Everyone living with multiple people under one roof. Basically every renter/home-owner. 
* **Habit:** Users are constantly updating and checking this app to remind themselves to finish their chores before the deadline. Could be used daily, weekly, monthly. 
* **Scope:** 
    * MVP: shared list of weekly, daily, monthly chores that have to be done. Assign chores, check them off. 
    * V2: ability to take pictures.
    * V3: social element. Feed to see if you're friends are doing their chores. Integration with payment app... so when someone failed to do a chore it costs them money, which then gets distributed amongst the other housemates.
